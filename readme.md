# Description
A continuation of a previous demo I have hosted at Gitlab based on the &quot;All About React Router 4&quot; lesson found at css&#45;tricks.com.

## Please visit
You can see [the lesson at netlify](https://ghtest-rr5-refactored.netlify.com/ "the lesson at netlify") and decide if this is something for you to play around with at a later date.

## Why I composed another React Router Project
It has a few different items than the previous version. I used Create React App in lieu of Webpack. Plus, it utilizes React Transition Group routing animations along with Bootstrap. 

## Netlify Functionality is Included
I am presently on a Netlify kick. This is a use case that is located in the Netlify Docs&#45;&#45; the [Rewrites &amp; Proxies](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/#history-pushstate-and-single-page-apps "link to SPA rewrites section") section to be specific &#45;&#45; that has been fleshed out. Hence, I decided to keep three distinct branches: master, gh&#45;pages, and netlification which all should be self&#45;explanatory and are unique in scope. 

## What it does not have
It is a **work in progress** and I will likely further develop the nested routing so that it is more dynamic to include a second parameter. I, then, will finalize the dummy data to include a links to youtube videos embedded in Bootstrap modals as I see fit. For now I want to keep the Netlify vibe going and not take my eye off of the ball.
